Question: What could be improved in the search, pinned settings, or collapsible categories?

Responses:
  - I’d like to pin a couple more settings if possible.
  - Search could guess what I’m typing based on past searches.
  - Pinned section could let me drag to reorder the icons.
  - Collapsible headers could be a bit bolder when they’re closed.
  - A smoother fade when categories collapse might look nicer.
  - Pinned settings could suggest things I use a lot, like the Recently Used section does.
  - A little icon by the collapsible headers could show what’s inside.
  - Let me reorder the pinned icons to match how I use them.
  - A reset button in the pinned modal could be handy to start over.
  - Pinned settings could show which ones I use most with a highlight.
  - Collapsible animations could speed up a little for quick use.
  - A search history dropdown could help me jump back to recent stuff.
  - A small label under pinned icons might help with less obvious ones.
  - Search could bold the matched words in results to spot them faster.
  - Pinned settings could pick up my most-used options on their own.
